#Smart Outlet
This program is a web server that runs on Arduino Uno that allows users to connect to it and then control
whether the power supply connected to the Arduino, nicknamed the "Smart Outlet," is flowing or not.
The Arduino is conneceted to a Solid State Relay through digital pin 8 (can be changed) and the Solid State
Relay controls the flow of electricity through the outlet.
